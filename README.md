# Tkinter-Project
Tkinter GUI for Prime Factorization and List Operations
This project is a Tkinter-based Python GUI application that provides two key functionalities:

-Finding the Largest Prime Factor of a given number

-Performing List Operations such as insertion, deletion, and appending

->Features
1. Largest Prime Factor Finder
   
-Displays Python code for finding the largest prime factor of a number

-Allows users to input a number and compute its largest prime factor

-Shows the result dynamically on the GUI

2. List Operations Manager
   
-Displays Python code for various list operations

-Allows users to create a list by entering space-separated values

-Supports the following operations:

1)Insert an element at a specific position

2)Delete an element from a given position

3)Append a new element to the list

4)Display the updated list

->Technologies Used

-Python (Tkinter for GUI)

-ScrolledText Widget (for displaying code snippets)

-Error Handling (for handling incorrect user inputs)

->Future Enhancements

-Add more mathematical and data structure operations

-Improve UI with better design and themes

-Implement data persistence using SQLite
